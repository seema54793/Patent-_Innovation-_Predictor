# Patent_Innovation_Predictor
This project helps you find patterns in **patents** and predict **future innovations** in a specific technology field (like lithium batteries).

It uses **AI agents** (small smart programs), a **local language model** (like ChatGPT on your computer), and a **search engine** to go through patent data and give useful insights.

---

## 💡 What This Project Does

- Finds and reads patents stored in OpenSearch
- Uses different agents (helpers) to:
  - Decide what to research
  - Find the best patents
  - Analyze data and trends
  - Predict new ideas for the future
- Uses local AI (via **Ollama**) so you don’t need an internet-based API

- ## 🧰 Tools Used

- 🐍 Python 3.10+
- 🧠 Ollama (to run LLM models like deepseek-r1 locally)
- 🔎 OpenSearch (stores and searches patent data)
- ⚙️ Docker (runs services easily)
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 CrewAI (to organize multiple AI agents)

📌 Example Use Case
You want to explore future ideas in lithium battery development.
The system searches patents, finds trends, and suggests areas where new inventions might happen.
